The tl0_retransmisson_algorithm was developed and embeded in baresip 
in order to exploit the features of SVC (pyramid-like hierarchy etc) standard 
so as by detecting, requesting and retransmitting the base layer of the coded video bitstream 
would result in adding resilience in case of losess enabling robust video experience as well as other desirable characteristics.
